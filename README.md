# ------ RTK [Redux Toolkit Query] -----
1. INTRODUCTION
    - According to Redux Toolkit documentation,
        - RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.
        - This feature is an optional add-on in the Redux Toolkit package, so if you are using Redux Toolkit in your project, it means your project has access to the RTK query.
